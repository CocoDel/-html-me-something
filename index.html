                  superhighway of the jungle - The Amazon River.
                  We visited an animal santuary where you can get up close
                  with most of their animals; from playful monkeys, to exotic birds,
                  to anacondas!!"

                  variations of potatoes and hundreds of recepies for potatoes.  Here we are enjoying al fresco restaurant by 
                  the Amazon River.  The fish is caught that same day and it's prepared and served that same day.  It can't get
                  any fresher and delicious - yum yum "
