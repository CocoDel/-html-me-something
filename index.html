                  We visited an animal sanctuary where you can get up close
                  with most of their animals; from playful monkeys, to exotic birds,
                  to anacondas!!"

                  "The people of Peru&#769 love their food.  It is natural or as we like to say organic. There are 30+
                  variations of potatoes and hundreds of recipes for potatoes.  Here we are enjoying al fresco restaurant by 
                  the Amazon River.  The fish is caught that same day and it's prepared and served that same day.  It can't get
                  any fresher and delicious - yum yum "
